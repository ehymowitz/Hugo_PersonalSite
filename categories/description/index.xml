      <description>Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! This is still VERY much a work in progress. 
It is also where I get to write and post about things that I make and work on. So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning about me this is the place for that. This part of the website is a little bit about me! 
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Seattle, Washington but I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Montreal for the last 7 years (since 2012).</description>
