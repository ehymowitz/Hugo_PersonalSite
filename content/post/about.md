#### Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! This is where I get to write and post about things that I make and work on. I don't generally talk about myself too much, but here goes - if you're interested in learning about me this is the place for that.
<p>
#### When I was 18 I left my hometown of Seattle, Washington and spent a gap year living in Israel. After that I moved to Montreal to do an undergraduate degree in materials engineering at McGill University. During that time I learned and developed an appreciation for all STEM related topics, and also realized my passion for playing music. I picked up the bass guitar and never really put it down.

#### Nowadays, I'm still living in Montreal working at a great startup a called [Haply Robotics](http://haply.co/), and playing music with some amazing musicians and people. Aside from all this, I do a little bit of freelance work; teaching music, STEM topic tutoring, web design, and I'm beginning to get into some video production as well. If you'd like examples of my work or want to know anything more about me, I'd love to hear from you! You can also check out any of the links on the side panel of this website to see any of my social media links.
