Before I came here, I spent a gap year living in Israel. While studying engineering at McGill I developed an appreciation for all STEM related topics, and also realized my passion for playing music. I picked up the bass guitar and never really put it down.</h4>

While playing with these bands, I got involved in the vibrant Montreal jam scene, a network of events wherein musicians meet up in a live setting and just play! They&rsquo;re a great way to meet some great people and to try out new musical styles. I still frequently attend these jams, and am always thrilled to meet new musicians and play new music.</h4>

At Haply we work in the field of haptics, robotics dealing with the recreation of touch. Our goal is to make this technology accessible to those who wish to use and learn with it. We work across a wide range of aspects of this technology, but the core belief is that using haptics, interaction with technology takes on a whole new positive dimension.</h4>
